# Science and Engineering Crafts Made Fun

Our goal is to try and teach kids all about the principles of science and engineering through crafts. Some crafts include windmills, catapults, and coin tower challenges.

# How We Will Do Crafts
1. We will tell you the supplies and a basic description of the craft
2. Instructions will be shown on how to do the craft
3. Have fun with the craft and experiment!
4. A explanation of why what happened in the craft happened

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/shoeworld/shoeworld.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
